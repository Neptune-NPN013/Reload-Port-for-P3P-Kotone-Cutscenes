What is this?
This is a port of some of the cutscenes made for the Persona 3 Portable Kotone Cutscenes Project. A mod that implements reanimated versions of every cutscene from the original PS2 release of Persona 3 to match the Female protagonist route of Persona 3 Portable. This includes alternative versions of scenes for choices exclusive to this route (eg. Theodore or Elizabeth).

What is and isn't included from the P3P version?
The only cutscenes that are replaced are scenes that were 2D animated cutscenes in both P3R and P3P. If a scene was not 2D animated in either of these games, it is not replaced here. No additional cutscenes have been added, and scenes that were 3D in Reload are not included either. The original OP 'Moonlight Daydream' is included as an optional feature.

Does this support English and Japanese audio?
Yes. Audio language is determined by your language selection in game, just like the official cutscenes.

Will you add more scenes in the future?
Wether more scenes get added or not is dependant on how P3R modding progresses. Currently, nobody has discovered a method to add additional animated cutscenes to the game. Editing the audio in 3D animated cutscenes is also extremely difficult at the moment. Maybe these things will be possible in the future, but for now that is not the case.

Will you be reanimating Reload's cutscenes too?
Yes. It will be a long time before that is complete, but we will be reanimating the P3R animated cutscenes too. That mod will be more comprehensive than this one.
